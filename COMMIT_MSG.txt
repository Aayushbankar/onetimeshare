Day 13: Admin Authentication & Zero-Knowledge Privacy

The Pivot:
- Started with SQLAlchemy database approach (2h 43m)
- Realized config-based auth is simpler for single-admin
- Deleted everything and rebuilt in 8 minutes

Features:
- Config-based admin auth (credentials in .env)
- Flask-Login for browser session management
- Flask-JWT-Extended for API token authentication
- @admin_required decorator for route protection
- Admin dashboard with live stats
- File list page (anonymized tokens only)
- Auto-logout when leaving /admin routes (security)
- Zero-knowledge privacy: admins cannot see filenames

Security:
- Session expires on non-admin route access
- Protected /stats and /list-files routes
- JWT + session dual authentication support

Infrastructure:
- Updated docker-compose.yml with env vars and volumes
- Added Redis connection retry logic for Docker startup
- Cleaned up unused files (models/admin.py, scripts/)

Fixes:
- Fixed circular import (moved AdminUser to own module)
- Fixed Redis WRONGTYPE error in list_files
- Fixed stats route protection
- Fixed flash message accumulation on login

Documentation:
- 16 learning guides in notes_ai/Day_13/
- 5 pass mistake logs
- Textbook-style code explanation
- Day 13 detailed summary
