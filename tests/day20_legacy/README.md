# Day 20 Legacy Load Tests

These are the original load testing scripts from Day 20.
Kept for reference but superseded by the comprehensive Day 22 stress tests.

## Files
- `test_load.py` - Original baseline test (Pass 1)
- `test_load_pass2.py` - Gunicorn migration test (Pass 2)
- `test_load_pass3.py` - Spike test (Pass 3)

## Why Replaced?
Day 20 tests were ad-hoc and not systematically documented.
Day 22 introduces a proper 3-tier, 9-pass methodology.
