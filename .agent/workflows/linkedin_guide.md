# LinkedIn Content Guide v4.0: Heroic Realism

**Purpose**: High-engagement technical storytelling.
**Voice**: Vulnerable + Insightful + Sarcastic.

## 1. The "Heroic Realism" Formula

Successful posts (Day 6, 15, 18) share this DNA:
1.  **High Stakes**: "If I mess this up, users lose data." (Not just "oops").
2.  **Specific Failures**: "AttributeError", "HTTP 406". (Not generic "bugs").
3.  **Deep Insight**: "Frameworks exist for a reason." (Value beyond the story).
4.  **Savage Narrator**: The comic relief that keeps it grounded.

## 2. Formatting Rules (Strict)

- **Hook**: "🔥 [Statement]" (e.g., "I filed for divorce from Bootstrap.")
- **Separators**: `━━━━━━━━━━━━━`
- **Headers**: ALL CAPS (e.g., `THE GRAVEYARD:`, `THE DISCOVERY:`)
- **Lists**: Use `✅` for wins, `❌` or `🪦` for failures.
- **Links**: First Comment ONLY.

## 3. The Trifecta Check
Every post must have:
- **Pain**: "I spent 4 hours failing."
- **Humor**: Narrator roasting the user.
- **Value**: "Use `app.after_request`, not WSGI wrappers."

## 4. Post Types (Day 25 Specific)

### The "Illusion" Post
- Focus: "I thought my app was secure. `curl` proved me wrong."
- **Vibe**: Detective thriller / Realization.

### The "Technical Growth" Post
- Focus: "I fought the framework and lost. Then I learned."
- **Vibe**: Humility / Senior Engineer Wisdom.

### The "Philosophy" Post
- Focus: "Security isn't a feature. It's a mindset."
- **Vibe**: The "Unpopular Opinion" style (Day 24).
