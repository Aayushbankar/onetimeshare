## What Was Built Today

### Documentation Suite
All project documentation finalized for v1.0.0 launch:

| Document               | Lines | Purpose                    |
| ---------------------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| `docs/API.md`          | 200+  | Full REST API reference    |
| `CHANGELOG.md`         | 180+  | 27 days of version history |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | 100+  | Mermaid diagrams           |

### AI-Assisted Workflow
Used Gemini AI for documentation generation because:
- Docs are tedious but critical
- AI excels at boilerplate and formatting
- Human review ensures accuracy

## Technical Details

### API Documentation Coverage
- 8 public endpoints documented
- 4 admin endpoints documented
- Request/response examples for all
- Authentication section (JWT + Session)
- Rate limit documentation
- Error response format

### Changelog Structure
- Keep a Changelog format
- Semantic versioning
- All 27 days chronicled
- Version 1.0.0 ready

### Architecture Diagrams
1. **System Overview**: Client → Gateway → App → Data layers
2. **Upload Flow**: Sequence diagram with encryption
3. **Download Flow**: Sequence diagram with decryption
4. **Security Layers**: Defense in depth visualization

## Key Learnings

1. **AI is leverage** — Use it for scale (docs, boilerplate), not creativity
2. **Documentation is iterative** — Review and refine after generation
3. **Mermaid is powerful** — Diagrams as code for easy maintenance
4. **Keep a Changelog** — Standard format for readers
5. **Link documentation** — Added "📚 Documentation" section to README
