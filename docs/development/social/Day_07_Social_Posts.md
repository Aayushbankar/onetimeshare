🔥 Day 7/30: I deleted my own code 4 times this week. Here's why I'd do it again.

Week 1 of #OneTimeShare30 is done.

7 days. 70+ bugs. One working self-destructing file sharing app.

Let me show you what building in public actually looks like.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The numbers:

↳ 26 hours of focused coding
↳ 500+ lines of production code  
↳ 8 API endpoints shipping
↳ 70+ bugs caught and killed
↳ 40+ learning guides written
↳ 5 moments where I almost quit

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The ugly truth nobody shows:

Day 1 → Flask wouldn't start. Spent 2 hours on a typo.

Day 2 → "File upload works!" ...folder was empty. file.save() was commented out. 🤦

Day 3 → Refactored everything. Broke everything. Refactored again.

Day 4 → Tried Figma for UI. Failed. Pivoted to AI mockups. Saved 3 hours.

Day 5 → Download worked. Then didn't. Then worked. Config path was wrong.

Day 6 → 29 mistakes before delete actually worked. Found a bug at 3 PM that would've broken production.

Day 7 → Ran the full flow. It works. Actually works.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The bug that almost shipped:

```python
# What I wrote (WRONG):
directory=Config.UPLOAD_FOLDER

# What it should be:
directory=current_app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']
```

One line. Files would NEVER delete. Found it only because I tested like a user.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4 lessons that will save you weeks:

1️⃣ "Understanding" ≠ "Building"
   I understood Flask, Redis, Docker separately.
   Together? That's where learning happens.

2️⃣ D+ → A is the real path
   Day 6 took 5 passes. First was 55%. Last was 95%.
   That's not failure. That's iteration.

3️⃣ Test like a user, think like a hacker
   "It compiles" is worthless.
   "I uploaded, downloaded, and it deleted" is proof.

4️⃣ Document while bleeding
   Write the lesson when it hurts.
   40 guides later, Week 2 will thank Week 1.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What's actually working now:

✅ Drag-and-drop file upload
✅ Atomic self-destruct (race-condition safe!)
✅ Download once → deleted forever
✅ Orphan cleanup runs automatically
✅ Custom 404 for expired links

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Week 2 starts tomorrow:
→ Password protection
→ Rate limiting  
→ Security hardening

It's New Year's Eve.

What are you shipping in 2026?

I don't mean "learning" or "exploring."

I mean SHIPPING. What's going live?

# 📱 POST B: EVENING (7:00 PM IST)

## 🎆 New Year Resolution — Vulnerability Post

**COPY FROM HERE:**

🎆 I almost didn't start.

"I'm not ready."
"My code is embarrassing."  
"Nobody cares about another side project."

That was me 7 days ago.

Today? I have 500+ lines of working code, 8 endpoints, and an app that actually works.

Here's what changed:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I stopped waiting to be ready.

Day 1: Posted "I'm building this" on LinkedIn.
Day 2: My file upload returned "success" while the folder was empty. 🤦
Day 3: I refactored. It broke. I fixed it. Publicly.
Day 4: Tried Figma. Failed. Posted about failing.
Day 5: Download worked. Then didn't. Posted that too.
Day 6: 29 bugs. All documented. All fixed.
Day 7: It works.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The scariest part wasn't the bugs.

It was showing people the bugs.

But here's what I learned:

→ Nobody judged me for failing
→ People actually ROOTED for the comeback
→ The posts about mistakes got MORE engagement

Turns out, people don't want perfection.
They want progress they can relate to.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

70+ mistakes documented publicly.
40+ lessons written while frustrated.
0 regrets.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2026 is here in a few hours.

What's the one thing you've been "too scared" to start?

Not "interested in learning."
Not "maybe someday."

The thing you KNOW you should build but keep putting off.

Drop it below. Say it out loud.

That's step 1.

Happy New Year. 🎉

# 🐦 TWITTER/X THREAD (Post at 9:00 AM)

**Tweet 1:**
```
Day 7/30: Week 1 of building in public is DONE 🎉

7 days
70+ bugs  
29 of those on Day 6 alone
1 working self-destructing file sharing app

The journey was ugly. Here's the truth 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Day 2: My upload endpoint returned "success"

I checked the folder.

Empty.

file.save() was commented out. The API was lying to me.

Lesson: Never trust success messages you wrote yourself 😅
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Day 6: The bug that almost shipped to production:

Config.UPLOAD_FOLDER ❌
current_app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] ✅

One line = files NEVER delete = disk explodes.

Found it only because I tested like a user, not a developer.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
The pattern from 7 days:

Day 1: D+ (55%)
Day 2: C (70%)  
Day 3: B- (78%)
Day 6: Started at D+, ended at A (95%)

Iteration > Perfection.

Every. Single. Time.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
What's actually shipping:

✅ Upload files (drag-drop)
✅ Get unique link
✅ Download once → file deletes itself
✅ Atomic deletion (race-safe)
✅ Auto orphan cleanup

Real. Working. Open source.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
2026 is tomorrow.

What are you SHIPPING this year?

Not learning. Not exploring.

Shipping.

Day 6 → 29 bugs in ONE DAY

But here's the thing:

Nobody judged the failures.
People rooted for the comeback.

70+ mistakes. 40+ lessons. 0 regrets.
