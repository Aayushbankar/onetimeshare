🔥 Day 10/30: 30 Minutes Staring at a Counter That Wouldn't Count. Then Another 30 Finding ONE Missing Line.

Day 10. Password verification. Should've taken 2 hours.

Narrator: "Buckle up. This will be painful."

Took 4.5. With 26 bugs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE COUNTER FROM HELL:

cnt = 0
When password wrong:
    cnt += 1

Wrong password → "Attempt 1 of 5"
Wrong password → "Attempt 1 of 5"  
Wrong password → "Attempt 1 of 5"

Tested 15 times. Stuck at 1.

Narrator: "The counter had more stability than his understanding of HTTP."

Restarted everything. LAPTOP included. Still at 1.

Then: HTTP has no memory. "cnt = 0" runs EVERY REQUEST.

Narrator: "He discovered what HTTP's been screaming since 1991. Stateless. It's in the docs."

I felt stupid.

Narrator: "Growth starts with self-awareness."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE "FIX" THAT WASN'T:

attempts = redis.get('counter')
attempts += 1
redis.save('counter', attempts)

This HAS to work.

Narrator: "It will not. Grab popcorn."

STILL STUCK. 20 minutes later:

def store_file_metadata():
    save: filename
    save: password_hash
    # password_attempts? ← MISSING

Narrator: "A save function. That doesn't save. Chef's kiss."

ONE LINE.

Narrator: "Not quantum physics. One line. Like forgetting to hit Send."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THEN REDIS EXPLODED:

BOOM. WRONGTYPE. Called hgetall() on strings.

Narrator: "That's confidently wrong. Like asking a librarian to cook dinner."

Don't judge.

Narrator: "Too late. Guilty."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EARLIER CARNAGE:

• Deleted files BEFORE passwords
• Read POST from GET  
• Compared bcrypt with ==

Narrator: "Pass 1 was a cry for help disguised as Python."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WORKED:

✅ Three routes
✅ Persistent retry limits
✅ Bcrypt security

26 bugs and "character development."

Narrator: "'Development' is generous for 'learned HTTP after 4.5 hours.'"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TRUTH:

Web apps are distributed systems in disguise.

Narrator: "HTTP forgets faster than your ex. At least it's consistent."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TAKEAWAYS:

1️⃣ HTTP is stateless and will gaslight you
2️⃣ Local variables are lies
3️⃣ If you don't save it, it's fiction
4️⃣ Manual testing finds haunting bugs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why share?

"Build in Public" with only wins? Disney movies for devs.

Reality: 26 bugs. 3 rage-quits. Googling "is farming hard"

Narrator: "Persisted not from bravery, but because quitting = admitting defeat. Stubbornness: 10/10. Reading docs: 0/10."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now working:
✅ Bcrypt verification
✅ Retry limits that COUNT
✅ Files that lock
✅ Sanity (citation needed)
