🔥 Day 4/30: The Frontend Arc

Started: 11:30 AM
Currently: 4 PM
Status: Alive. Barely. Functioning.

---

Let me tell you about today.

I've built websites before. I know web dev. I have actual deployed projects that real humans use.

So when I woke up thinking "today I'll do the frontend," I genuinely believed it would take 2-3 hours. Maybe 4 if I'm slow.

It took the whole day.

---

THE FIGMA ARC:

First mistake: opened Figma.

I've never used Figma. I thought "how hard can it be, it's just shapes."

1 hour 10 minutes later I had a skeleton that looked like it was designed by someone who's only ever described websites to a sketch artist. Over the phone. In a different language.

That's when I realized: design is not my thing. Design has never been my thing. I just forgot because I always used templates.

Pivoted. Used AI to generate mockups. 25 minutes. 4 screens. Done.

Lesson: Leverage your tools. Stop making yourself suffer for no reason.

---

THE CSS/TEMPLATE ARC:

I know HTML/CSS. I've written it before. I've shipped projects with it.

But writing it from scratch? Clean? Matching a design?

My brain forgot how flexbox works. I'm not joking. I stared at `justify-content: center` like it was hieroglyphics.

Template errors everywhere. `{% include %}` is not `{% extends %}`. An hour of my life. Gone.

---

THE JAVASCRIPT ARC:

This is where it got philosophical.

I know JavaScript. I've used it in projects. I can READ it. I understand what it does.

Writing it from scratch?

Fighting Mahoraga from JJK.

On basics.

Every function I wrote felt like: "I know what this should do. Why is my brain empty. Why am I Googling 'how to add event listener.' I've done this. I'VE DONE THIS."

It's like eating a candy that looks sweet on the outside but the core is lava. Users enjoy the melted chocolate. Devs like me know the center is a hellhole.

---

THE REAL STORY:

I leaned on AI. Hard.

Prompt engineering got me through CSS. Got me through the boilerplate. Got me through the parts where my brain just... buffered.

But here's the thing: I still laid every brick. I chose what goes where. I understood what I was accepting. I debugged. I connected pieces. I made decisions.

AI is leverage. Not replacement. 

I was mid-build, mid-doubt, staring at code going "what the hell is this" — and I kept building anyway.

---

THE RESULT:

By 4 PM:

✅ Industrial design theme (dark, orange, hard shadows)
✅ Drag-and-drop file uploads
✅ Progress bar that actually animates
✅ Success screen with shareable link
✅ Download page showing metadata

It works. It looks good. It's deployed.

---

THE POINT:

I underestimated frontend. Simple as that.

Not because it's "hard" — but because writing it clean, from scratch, matching a design, while learning gaps you didn't know you had?

That's a different game.

Day 4 was a grind. It was messy. It was humbling.

And now it's done.

---

Day 5: File download + one-time delete. Backend.

My territory. Finally.

💬 Ever underestimated something so badly your entire day became about it?

That was me today. With CSS.

I underestimated frontend.

Not "I failed at frontend."
I. Under. Estimated. It.

Thread about what happened ⬇️

**Tweet 2:**
Opened Figma for the first time.

"How hard can it be, it's just shapes."

1 hour later: a skeleton that looked like I described a website to someone. Over phone. In Morse code.

Lesson learned: Design is a skill. I don't have it.

---

**Tweet 3:**
Pivoted to AI-generated mockups.

25 minutes. 4 screens. Done.

Sometimes the smartest thing you can do is stop suffering and use better tools.

---

**Tweet 4:**
CSS from scratch.

I've written CSS before. I know flexbox. I've shipped projects.

Today my brain forgot everything.

Stared at `justify-content: center` like it was ancient scripture.

---

**Tweet 5:**
Jinja templates:

Me: {% include 'base.html' %}
Flask: TemplateNotFound
Me: ???
Flask: It's {% extends %}
Me: ...
Flask: 😊

1 hour debugging.

---

**Tweet 6:**
The JavaScript arc was existential.

I KNOW JS. I've used it. I can READ it.

Writing it from scratch?

Fighting Mahoraga on basics.

My brain: "I know what this does. Why am I empty."

---

**Tweet 7:**
Writing JS from scratch is like eating candy with a lava core.

Looks sweet outside.
Users enjoy the chocolate.
Devs know the inside is a hellhole.

I'm in the hellhole.

---

**Tweet 8:**
I leaned on AI. Hard.

Prompt engineering. CSS generation. Boilerplate.

But I laid every brick. Made every decision. Debugged everything.

AI is leverage. I'm still the architect.

---

**Tweet 9:**
By 4 PM:

✅ Dark industrial theme
✅ Drag-and-drop uploads  
✅ Progress bar
✅ Download page

It works. It's deployed. I survived.

Day 5: Backend. My territory.

Today was humbling. Messy. A grind.

But I kept building. Mid-doubt. Mid-buffering. Mid-"what the hell is this."

That's the job.

🔥 Day 4/30: Frontend Arc

11:30 AM → 4 PM
Brain status: minimal

The journey:
🔴 Figma → "just shapes" → 1hr skeleton → gave up
🟢 AI mockups → 25 min → done
🔴 CSS from scratch → forgot flexbox → chaos
🔴 JS from scratch → fighting Mahoraga on basics

Fighting Mahoraga = the "impossible to kill" boss from JJK.

That was me. With event listeners.

I leaned on AI. Hard. Prompt engineering carried.

But I still laid the bricks. Still made decisions. Still debugged.

Result: ✅ Working frontend. Dark theme. Drag-drop. Progress bar.

Day 5: Backend. My territory. Finally.

Day 4.

Started 11:30 AM thinking "frontend? 3 hours max."

It's 4 PM. I'm alive. Barely.

I underestimated web dev. I've done it before. I have deployed projects.

But from scratch? Clean? Matching a design?

Different game.

I leaned on AI. Hard.

Prompt engineering for CSS.
Prompt engineering for boilerplate.
Prompt engineering when my brain buffered.

But I still laid every brick.
AI is leverage. Not replacement.
