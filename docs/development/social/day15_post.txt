🔐 Day 15/30: I Sat Down to Code Encryption. 4.5 Hours Later, Zero Lines Written.

Smartest thing I've done all month.

Narrator: "Character development! From the guy who learned HTTP is stateless on Day 10. After 4.5 hours. It's been stateless since 1991."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

11:28 AM — THE SCENE:

Coffee? Fresh.
Confidence? Dangerous.
Plan? "Fernet. AES. Stack Overflow. Ship by lunch."

Then I had a thought. A rare one.

"What if I... research this first?"

Narrator: "I know. I'm as shocked as you are."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE STAKES:

14 days. 100+ bugs fixed. All depending on ONE thing:

File encryption. The heart of a "secure" file sharing app.

If I get this wrong?

Narrator: "Every feature becomes a liability. Every user becomes a lawsuit. No pressure."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE GRAVEYARD:

🪦 184 HTTPS SERVERS (2016)
Banks. Credit cards. All compromised.
Cause: Reused a 12-byte number. ONCE.

Narrator: "It's called a NONCE. 'Number used ONCE.' They had one job."

🪦 APPLE (2014)
Every device. SSL validation gone.
Cause: One duplicated line.

Narrator: "The 'goto fail;' bug. One extra line. Tim Cook cried. Probably."

🪦 UBER (2016)
57 million records exposed.
Cause: AWS keys in PUBLIC GitHub.

Narrator: "$148 million to learn what .gitignore does. Stack Overflow is free."

🪦 HEARTBLEED (2014)
17% of secure servers leaking keys.
In production: 2 years. UNNOTICED.

Narrator: "If this doesn't terrify you, you don't understand the assignment."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE REALIZATIONS:

1. Encryption is EASY. Key management kills apps.

Narrator: "Your .env committed to GitHub? Less fine."

2. One bug = TOTAL compromise.

Narrator: "Crypto bugs don't give warnings. They give subpoenas."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE DECISIONS:

✅ ChaCha20-Poly1305 (Signal + WireGuard use it)
✅ Argon2id (OWASP 2024 pick, won Password Hashing Competition)
✅ 64KB Chunking (20MB file = 128KB RAM)
✅ Hybrid Keys (password = zero-knowledge)

Narrator: "He's following people who know what they're doing. Day 15. Progress."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

END OF DAY:

Lines of code: 0
Guides created: 6
Incidents studied: 5
Decisions made: 5

Narrator: "4.5 hours NOT coding. Most productive security decision ever. Irony is encrypted now."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What's one thing you shipped first and Googled later?

Narrator: "The comments are becoming a confessional. We all have sins."
