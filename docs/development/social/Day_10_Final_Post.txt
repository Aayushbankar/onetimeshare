🔥 Day 10/30: 30 Minutes Staring at a Counter That Wouldn't Count. Then Another 30 Finding ONE Missing Line.

Day 10. Password verification. Should've taken 2 hours.

Narrator: "It did not."

Took 4.5. With 26 bugs. Me having an existential crisis.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE COUNTER FROM HELL:

I wrote this:

cnt = 0
When password wrong:
    cnt += 1

Wrong password → "Attempt 1 of 5"
Wrong password → "Attempt 1 of 5"  
Wrong password → "Attempt 1 of 5"

Tested 15 times. FIFTEEN. Stuck at 1.

Added logs. Restarted everything. Even my LAPTOP. Still at 1.

Then: HTTP has no memory. "cnt = 0" runs EVERY REQUEST.

Narrator: "Fighting HTTP's core design. Like arguing with gravity."

I felt so stupid.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE "FIX" THAT WASN'T:

Fine. Redis it is.

attempts = redis.get('counter')
attempts += 1
redis.save('counter', attempts)

This HAS to work.

Narrator: "It did not."

STILL STUCK. 20 minutes later:

def store_file_metadata():
    save: filename
    save: password_hash
    # password_attempts? ← MISSING

I was updating it. Incrementing it. Doing EVERYTHING.

Except saving it to Redis.

Narrator: "Python updated memory. Redis sipped tea."

ONE LINE. Laptop-throwing levels of rage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THEN REDIS EXPLODED:

Fixed counter. Ran cleanup. BOOM. WRONGTYPE error.

Called hgetall() on EVERY key. Strings. Sets. Lists.

Narrator: "Opening a PDF with a hammer."

Don't judge me.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EARLIER CARNAGE:

• Deleted files BEFORE passwords
• Read POST from GET
• Compared bcrypt with ==

Narrator: "Performance art in bad security."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WORKED:

✅ Three routes
✅ Persistent retry limits
✅ Bcrypt security

Took 26 bugs and "character development."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TRUTH:

Web apps are distributed systems in disguise.

Every page = amnesia. Variables die. Databases remember.

Narrator: "HTTP asks your name every time. For 10 years."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TAKEAWAYS:

1️⃣ HTTP is stateless and will gaslight you
2️⃣ Local variables are lies
3️⃣ If you don't save it, it's gone
4️⃣ Manual testing finds 3 AM bugs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why share?

"Build in Public" showing only wins? LYING.

Reality: 26 bugs. 3 rage-quits. Me Googling "is farming hard"

Narrator: "Like Sisyphus. Or a determined moth."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now working:
✅ Bcrypt verification
✅ Retry limits that COUNT
✅ Files that lock
✅ Sanity (debatable)
