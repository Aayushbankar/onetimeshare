## 📝 PRIMARY POST

🔥 Unpopular Opinion: Only Junior Devs write their own tests.

Day 24/30. I needed E2E tests.
I *could* have spent 4 hours memorizing Playwright selectors.
Instead, I spent 15 minutes prompting AI.

Narrator: "He calls it 'delegation.' We call it 'severe caffeine deficiency.'"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE CLAIM

There is a myth that "writing tests helps you understand the code."
No.
*Reading* tests helps you understand the code.
*Writing* them just gives you carpal tunnel.

I fired myself as the "Test Writer" today.
I became the "Test Architect."

I told the AI: "Here is the app. Break it."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE RESULT (CHAOS)

The AI code was... aggressive.
It clicked "Download" so fast that it triggered my own Rate Limiter.

**Result**: HTTP 429.
My own test suite DDoS’d me.
I was locked out of my own localhost for 10 minutes.

Narrator: "He built a security system so good it flagged him as a threat. Genius."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE SAVE

But then, the AI caught something I missed.
My 404 page title was "LOST IN SPACE".
My generated test expected "FILE NOT FOUND".

I’ve looked at that page 100 times. I never noticed.
The AI noticed in 3 seconds.

It also caught a `NameError` because I forgot to import `re`.
(Yes, I forgot to import regex. Don't judge me.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE NUANCE

I didn't just "copy-paste" the code.
I had to debug the dependencies (`pytest-cov` was missing).
I had to flush Redis to fix the 429s.

The AI did the grunt work.
I did the brain work.

That is the future of Senior Engineering.
We are not typists. We are Editors.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Stop wearing "I write boilerplate" as a badge of honor.
It’s not a badge. It’s inefficiency.

Narrator: "He says 'inefficiency' because he wants to go play video games. But he's right."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now automated:
✅ Full Upload -> Download -> Expire Flow
✅ 404 & Error Handling Verified
✅ My ego (checked by a chatbot)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Agree or Disagree?
Drop a 🤖 if you let AI handle the tests.
Drop a 📝 if you still write them by hand.

Narrator: "If you chose the pen, we assert(sanity == False)."

## 💬 FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

🔗 GitHub: github.com/Aayushbankar/onetimeshare

The "Chaos Suite": tests/e2e/test_download.py

What broke today:
1.  **Self-DDoS**: My tests were too fast for Flask-Limiter.
2.  **Missing Imports**: `NameError: name 're' is not defined`.
3.  **UI Blindness**: I missed a text change that AI caught instantly.

Narrator: "If your tests don't accidentally DDoS you, are you even testing? ⭐"

Unpopular Opinion: Only Junior Devs write their own tests.

Day 24.
I let AI write my E2E suite.
It wrote code so fast it DDoS'd my own API (HTTP 429).
It caught UI bugs I've ignored for 10 days.

I didn't write code. I fixed dependencies.
I am not the Writer. I am the Editor.
