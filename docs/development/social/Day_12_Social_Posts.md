🔥 Day 12/30: I Deleted 105 Lines of Code Today. All of It Was Mine. No Regrets. (Okay, Some Regrets.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Welcome to 2026's first Monday.

Some people are setting goals. I'm setting fires. In my own codebase.

Narrator: "This is fine. Everything is fine."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I'M BUILDING:

OneTimeShare. Secure file sharing. Upload once. Download once. File vanishes.

Think: sending a file that ghosts itself before you can. Finally. Technology that understands boundaries.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE SCENE:

I had try-catch blocks in every route. EVERY. ROUTE.

7 routes. 15 lines each. 105 lines of "protection."

Narrator: "Protection implies it protects. His didn't. It was decorative. Like a seatbelt made of spaghetti."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE EVIDENCE:

Route 1: try... except... return 503
Route 3: try... except... return 504... I think?
Route 5: try... except... render_template('error')

See Route 5? No return statement. The function just... continues. Into the void.

Narrator: "His code said 'acknowledge error and keep walking.' Bold strategy."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE TEST:

Killed Redis. Uploaded file.

Expected: Pretty 503 page.
Got: White screen. Stack trace. Public embarrassment.

Narrator: "The app had a public meltdown. In production. On a Monday. The audacity. The drama. We stan."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE FIX:

Deleted all 105 lines. Wrote one decorator. 25 lines.

@handle_redis_error
def literally_any_route():
    # just the business logic
    # the decorator handles the drama

Narrator: "Less code. Same protection. More sleep. Revolutionary."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PLOT TWIST:

Forgot @wraps(fn).

Flask named every route "wrapper." All seven.

Flask: "Which wrapper?"
Me: "Yes."

Narrator: "It's giving 'I'll call everyone babe so I don't mess up names.' Flask wasn't impressed."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WORKS NOW:

✅ Redis crashes → friendly error page
✅ Stack traces → gone
✅ 105 lines → 25 lines

Time: ~3 hours
Sanity: negotiable

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2026 LESSONS (Day 1):

1️⃣ Copy-paste multiplies bugs, not safety
2️⃣ Decorators exist. Use them.
3️⃣ @wraps(fn) is mandatory
4️⃣ Sometimes the fix is DELETE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━

First Monday of 2026. The chaos has begun.

Narrator: "He survived Day 12. The code has been humbled. His ego too. Balance restored."

Tomorrow: Day 13. Pray for me.

Your turn — what's YOUR first Monday code disaster? 👇

🔗 The evidence: github.com/Aayushbankar/onetimeshare

The decorator catches:
→ ConnectionError → 503
→ TimeoutError → 504
→ Everything else → 500

Narrator: "Star the repo. It validates him."
